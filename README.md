## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Tech      | Description                          |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| HTML5     | 	The core language used for structuring the content and layout of the page. It defines all the elements, including the countdown timer, announcement bar, buttons, and links.           |
| CSS3      | Utilized for styling the webpage, including responsive layouts for mobile and desktop users, as well as implementing the Glassmorphism design. It also provides effects like the smooth UI reveal for the Play Now button and floating announcement bar.        |
| JavaScript | Powers the dynamic functionality of the page. This includes the countdown timer, the logic for displaying the Play Now button when the game is live, and handling user interactions like embedded YouTube video previews. JavaScript also manages the floating announcement bar updates.  |
| GitHub Pages | Hosting solution for static websites. This allows the project to be publicly accessible, providing free hosting for the countdown page and supporting a global user base with fast loading times.                |
| jQuery (Optional) | If included, jQuery could help manage DOM elements more efficiently, handle animations like the UI reveal, and add AJAX functionality for future updates without reloading the page.              |
| Font Awesome | Used for adding visually appealing icons to buttons (like the Play Now button) and links. It helps in enhancing the UI/UX by offering scalable vector icons that improve visual clarity.                |
| Google Fonts | Implements custom fonts for a unique and modern typographic style, contributing to the sleek design of the site and overall aesthetics.                |
| YouTube Embed API |  Utilized for embedding YouTube videos (teasers, trailers) directly into the webpage, ensuring seamless integration and providing a dynamic preview for users.               |
| CSS Variables | 	Used to define reusable values (like colors, margins, etc.) across the CSS, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain. This allows for quick theme customization, if needed.                |
| CSS Grid & Flexbox | 	Ensures the page is responsive and adapts smoothly to various screen sizes, making use of modern layout systems like CSS Grid for the overall page structure and Flexbox for organizing items like the announcement bar and countdown timer.                |
| Web Audio API (Optional) | If the Outro Audio feature is included, the Web Audio API could be utilized to provide enhanced control over audio playback, such as volume adjustments, looping, and timing synchronization with the countdown timer.                |
| Open Source Libraries (Future) | As the project grows, open-source JavaScript libraries like React or Vue.js could be considered for managing state and improving the interactivity of the page. This would make it easier to handle dynamic content like the countdown and announcements.                |
